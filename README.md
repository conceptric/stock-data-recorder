# Stock Data Recorder #

I like to keep track of my stock portfolio, but most historical data provides the Mid price. I want the Bid price for a more realistic estimate of the portfolio value.

That's why this simple project was created to regularly request, and store Bid and Ask prices for the specified stocks. I'm using Yahoo! Query Language to obtain these data from Yahoo! Finance.

# Installation #

You're welcome to try the code for yourself (point your Gemfile at this repo, or better yet, create a fork), but this is a work in progress, so there are no guarantees! Any financial losses you incurr from my little project are your own problem.                               

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. I'll decide whether I want to include it.
